"# House_Price" >> README.md
"#This is an exercise from Kaggle to create a model that predicts the price of the houses in the dataset, using Machine Learning in Python language.
In this model, i compared both models (XGBRegressor and RandomForestRegressor) in the "train.csv" dataset to train the model, and tested it in the "test.csv" dataset to predict the price of each house.
And the model had a better perfomance using the boost model, evaluated by the mean absolute error of the predicted prices agaisnt the true prices of the test dataset."
